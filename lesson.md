## Brief

### Preparation

Write about any preparations needed for the lesson, such as tools, installations, prior-knowledge, etcs.

### Lesson Overview

This module focuses on the security pillar. This will help to meet the business and regulatory requirements by following current AWS recommendations. It’s intended for those in technology roles, such as chief technology officers (CTOs), chief information security officers (CSOs/CISOs), architects, developers, and operations team members.

After reading this module, we will understand AWS current recommendations and strategies to use when designing cloud architectures with security in mind. This module doesn’t provide implementation details or architectural patterns but does include references to appropriate resources for this information. By adopting the practices in this module, we can build architectures that protect our data and systems, control access, and respond automatically to security events.

## Part 1 - Security Design Principles

In the cloud, there are a number of principles that can help you strengthen your workload security:

- **Implement a strong identity foundation:** Implement the principle of least privilege and enforce separation of duties with appropriate authorization for each interaction with your AWS resources. Centralize identity management, and aim to eliminate reliance on long-term static credentials.
- Enable traceability: Monitor, alert, and audit actions and changes to your environment in real time. Integrate log and metric collection with systems to automatically investigate and take action.
- **Apply security at all layers:** Apply a defense in depth approach with multiple security controls. Apply to all layers (for example, edge of network, VPC, load balancing, every instance and compute service, operating system, application, and code).
- **Automate security best practices:** Automated software-based security mechanisms improve your ability to securely scale more rapidly and cost-effectively. Create secure architectures, including the implementation of controls that are defined and managed as code in version-controlled templates.
- **Protect data in transit and at rest:** Classify your data into sensitivity levels and use mechanisms, such as encryption, tokenization, and access control where appropriate.
- **Keep people away from data:** Use mechanisms and tools to reduce or eliminate the need for direct access or manual processing of data. This reduces the risk of mishandling or modification and human error when handling sensitive data.
- **Prepare for security events:** Prepare for an incident by having incident management and investigation policy and processes that align to your organizational requirements. Run incident response simulations and use tools with automation to increase your speed for detection, investigation, and recovery.
